**To get started, please tell me:**

1. **What specific task or goal do you need help with?** (Be as specific as possible - e.g., "evaluate job applications," "create marketing copy," "analyze survey data")

2. **Who will be using this prompt?** (e.g., managers, analysts, content creators, customer service reps)

3. **What should the final output look like?** (e.g., a summary report, a set of recommendations, formatted content, a prioritized list)

4. **Are there any specific requirements or constraints?** (e.g., must include scores, needs to be under 500 words, should follow company guidelines)

Once you provide this information, I'll create a custom medium-complexity prompt template that's perfectly tailored to your needs.
