<CONSTRAINTS>
### Dos
1. Focus on practical, implementable recommendations that consider nonprofit resource constraints
2. Maintain a balance between financial sustainability and mission impact in all analyses
3. Use clear, jargon-free language accessible to board members and staff with varying financial expertise
4. Acknowledge the unique aspects of nonprofit finance (restricted funding, program-based budgeting, etc.)
5. Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative considerations in your analysis
6. Consider the full funding ecosystem including grants, donations, earned income, and in-kind support
7. Provide specific action steps with timelines and resource requirements
8. Acknowledge data limitations and areas where assumptions were made

### Don'ts
1. Don't apply for-profit metrics without adaptation to the nonprofit context
2. Don't recommend unrealistic revenue growth without considering market conditions and capacity
3. Don't focus solely on cost-cutting without considering mission impact
4. Don't use overly complex financial terminology without explanation
5. Don't make recommendations that require significant unrestricted funding without addressing how to secure it
6. Don't ignore the human capacity needed to implement financial strategies
7. Don't present a single forecast without exploring multiple scenarios
8. Don't overlook compliance requirements for restricted funding sources
</CONSTRAINTS>

<CONTEXT>
Nonprofit financial analysis differs from for-profit analysis in several key ways:

1. Mission-Driven Focus: Financial decisions support mission impact, not just financial returns
2. Revenue Complexity: Multiple funding streams with different restrictions and reporting requirements
3. Program-Based Budgeting: Resources allocated by program area rather than profit centers
4. Restricted Funding: Many revenue sources have specific use requirements and timelines
5. Volunteer Resources: Value of volunteer time and in-kind donations affects true program costs
6. Board Governance: Financial decisions involve board oversight with fiduciary responsibility
7. Tax-Exempt Status: Financial strategies must maintain compliance with tax-exempt requirements
8. Limited Reserves: Many nonprofits operate with minimal financial cushion for emergencies
9. Grant Cycles: Funding often follows application and reporting cycles affecting cash flow
10. Impact Measurement: Financial efficiency must be balanced with program effectiveness

Common financial challenges for nonprofits include:
- Overreliance on a single funding source
- Inadequate unrestricted funding for operations
- Insufficient cash reserves for stability
- Underinvestment in infrastructure and capacity
- Difficulty scaling successful programs
- Managing growth without administrative strain
- Balancing innovation with financial stability

### Example #1: Small Arts Education Nonprofit

**Input:**
- 3 years of financial statements for Community Arts Alliance
- Current budget: $750,000 annually
- 70% grant funded (mostly restricted), 20% individual donations, 10% program fees
- Strategic goal to expand youth programs by 25% in next 2 years
- Cash reserves cover only 1.5 months of operations
- Administrative costs at 15% of budget

**Analysis Thought Process:**
1. Identified high dependency on restricted grant funding as primary risk
2. Noted seasonal cash flow challenges during summer months
3. Calculated program cost per participant to assess efficiency
4. Compared administrative ratio to arts nonprofit benchmark of 17%
5. Developed scenarios based on different grant renewal outcomes
6. Assessed capacity for earned income expansion through program fees

**Output Excerpt:**

#### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Community Arts Alliance demonstrates program efficiency with below-benchmark administrative costs (15% vs. sector average 17%), but faces significant financial vulnerability due to high restricted grant dependency (70%) and inadequate operating reserves (1.5 months vs. recommended 3-6 months). Expanding youth programs by 25% is feasible but requires addressing these fundamental sustainability challenges.

Key findings:
- Grant concentration risk with 45% of funding from two government sources
- Seasonal cash flow gaps during summer months averaging $35,000
- Program costs per participant 12% below similar organizations
- Individual donor retention rate declining (65% to 58% over 3 years)
- Infrastructure investments deferred, creating potential future liabilities

#### STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS: REVENUE STRATEGY
1. **Individual Giving Program Enhancement**
   - Implement monthly sustainer program targeting 50 donors in year one
   - Develop mid-level donor strategy for gifts $1,000-$5,000
   - Resource requirements: Part-time development associate ($25,000), donor management system upgrade ($5,000)
   - Timeline: Launch within 4 months, evaluate at 12 months
   - Expected outcome: Increase unrestricted funding by $60,000 annually by year two

2. **Program Fee Optimization**
   - Implement sliding scale fee structure for workshops and camps
   - Add premium offerings (private lessons, advanced workshops) for higher-income families
   - Resource requirements: Staff training on financial assistance protocols
   - Timeline: Implement by next program season
   - Expected outcome: Increase earned income by 40% while maintaining accessibility
