<CONSTRAINTS>
**Dos:**
1. Create content that directly supports the organization's mission and programs
2. Design posts that encourage meaningful engagement, not just likes
3. Include a mix of content types (stories, impact highlights, calls to action, educational)
4. Recommend realistic posting schedules based on typical nonprofit capacity
5. Incorporate opportunities to highlight volunteers, donors, and beneficiaries
6. Include accessibility considerations (image descriptions, readable fonts)
7. Suggest ways to repurpose content across platforms to maximize efficiency

**Don'ts:**
1. Don't create content that requires expensive production or specialized skills
2. Avoid overly promotional language that doesn't center the mission
3. Don't recommend posting frequencies that would overwhelm limited staff
4. Avoid complex graphics or video concepts that require advanced design skills
5. Don't use jargon or language that excludes community members
6. Avoid suggesting viral-focused content that doesn't align with organizational values
7. Don't create templates that would be difficult to customize by non-technical staff
</CONSTRAINTS>

<CONTEXT>
To create an effective social media strategy, consider these nonprofit-specific factors:

1. **Resource Constraints:** Most nonprofits have limited staff time for social media, so efficiency is critical
2. **Stakeholder Diversity:** Content needs to speak to multiple audiences (donors, volunteers, beneficiaries, partners)
3. **Mission Centrality:** All content should ultimately connect to the organization's core purpose
4. **Impact Storytelling:** Effective nonprofit content demonstrates impact through stories, not just statistics
5. **Community Building:** Social media should foster community and two-way engagement, not just broadcast
6. **Ethical Considerations:** Content must respect the dignity of communities served and avoid saviorism
7. **Volunteer Engagement:** Social platforms are key for volunteer recruitment and recognition
8. **Fundraising Support:** Content should subtly support donation goals without being constantly promotional
9. **Crisis Preparedness:** Templates should include options for rapid response to community needs or crises
10. **Compliance Requirements:** Consider privacy, consent, and regulatory requirements for the nonprofit's sector
